# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To organize the code into separate files, you can create a folder structure like this:

src/
|-- components/
|   |-- App/
|       |-- App.js
|       |-- App.css
|       |-- Camera.js
|       |-- ImageGallery.js
|-- firebase/
|   |-- firebase.js
|-- utils/
|   |-- dataURItoBlob.js

## Setting Up the React App
1. Create a new React app using Create React App:

`npx create-react-app react-camera-app`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd react-camera-app`

3. Install necessary dependencies:

`npm install react-webcam firebase`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


## Setting Up the React App

1. Create a new React app using Create React App.
2. Install necessary dependencies such as `react-webcam` for camera functionality.
3. Set up the project structure.

## Implementing Camera Feature

1. Create a component for capturing images using the camera.
2. Integrate `react-webcam` or similar library for 'camera' functionality.
3. Implement logic to capture images and store them temporarily.

## Setting Up Firebase Project on Firebase Console:

1. Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click on the "Add project" button.
3. Enter a name for your project and click "Continue".
4. Choose whether to enable Google Analytics for your project and click "Continue".
4. Review the settings and click "Create project".

## Connecting Firebase to Your React App: ##

1. Install the Firebase SDK in your React app:

`npm install firebase`

2. Import Firebase and initialize it with your Firebase project configuration. You can find this configuration in the Firebase console under "Project settings" > "General" > "Your apps" > "Firebase SDK snippet" > "Config".

`// firebase.js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export default app;`


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
